# my_function

A custom, lightweight implementation of the C++ Standard Library's `std::function`. 

This project demonstrates the mechanics of **type erasure** and **template metaprogramming** by recreating a polymorphic function wrapper from scratch. It provides a unified interface to store, copy, and invoke any callable target—including lambda expressions, function pointers, and functors.
